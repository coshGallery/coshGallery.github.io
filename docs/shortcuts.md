# Keyboard Shortcuts

There are three main components to the user interface. The input area is
called the *slate*. The output area, above the slate, is called the *board*.
The text editor on the right is just called the *editor*.

Note: The <kbd>Meta</kbd> key refers to <kbd>Cmd</kbd> on OS X and
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> on everything else.
