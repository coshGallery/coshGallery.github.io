# CoffeeShop

CoffeeShop is a simple, but capable, CoffeeScript shell. It is designed to
be easy to use by people new to programming, but powerful too.

It has a familiar interface, a command line and text editor, but instead of
just outputting strings like a terminal would, it can potentially output
anything your browser can render.

CoffeeShop uses gists to let you share scripts. There are a few different ways
to share and use scripts, privately and with the world.

## About This Book

These docs are for people who already know CoffeeScript, to get up to speed on
how to use this shell. Separate content is currently being developed to learn
programming from.
